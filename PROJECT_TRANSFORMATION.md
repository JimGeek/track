## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Service Layer
- **Centralized Service**: Single `TodoApiService` class for all backend communication
- **Authentication**: Automatic JWT token refresh and error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

### Performance Optimizations
- **React.memo**: Expensive components wrapped for efficient re-renders
- **useCallback**: Event handlers optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders  
- **Debounced Search**: API calls optimized with 300ms debouncing
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for optimal bundle size

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, and custom hooks for local state
- **Context API**: Authentication and global state management
- **Local Storage**: Token persistence and user preferences
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before API confirmation for better UX

## 📦 Bundle Analysis

### Build Output
```
File sizes after gzip:
  184.51 kB  main.js       # Main application bundle
  10.26 kB   main.css      # Tailwind CSS styles  
  1.76 kB    chunk.js      # Code-split chunks
```

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: Optimized with code splitting
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Efficient image and component loading
