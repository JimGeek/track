# TrackFlow Mission (Lite)

TrackFlow is a minimalistic todo list application that helps productivity-focused individuals and teams manage multiple projects through intuitive task organization, providing comprehensive views (List, Kanban, Gantt) with lightning-fast performance inspired by Vercel and Notion's clean aesthetic.

TrackFlow serves freelancers, consultants, and small teams who need to manage multiple projects with varying priorities and deadlines. Unlike heavy project management platforms that take 3-5 seconds to load or oversimplified apps that lack features, TrackFlow provides exactly the right feature set with sub-second response times and minimalistic design that reduces cognitive load while maintaining powerful functionality across three seamless viewing modes.
