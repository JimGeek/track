# Track Mission (Lite)

Track is a comprehensive project and feature request management platform that transforms how development teams organize, visualize, and deliver complex projects.

Track serves project managers, development teams, and product managers who need to coordinate hierarchical feature development with intelligent deadline management and visual timeline analytics. Unlike flat project management tools, Track natively understands multi-level software projects with unlimited hierarchy depths, automatic overlap detection, and real-time collaboration features that eliminate timeline chaos and fragmented project visibility.
