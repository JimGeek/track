# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Performance Optimization
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimization across the entire application stack, focusing on database query optimization, intelligent caching strategies, lazy loading, code splitting, and real-time monitoring. This feature ensures the application remains fast and responsive as it scales to handle thousands of users and millions of tasks.

## User Stories

**As an end user, I want to:**
- Experience instant page loads and smooth interactions regardless of data volume
- See immediate feedback when performing actions with large datasets
- Have the application work efficiently even on slower devices and connections
- Experience consistent performance during peak usage times

**As a power user with extensive data, I want to:**
- Navigate through hundreds of tasks and projects without performance degradation
- Perform bulk operations on large datasets quickly and efficiently
- Experience responsive drag-and-drop even with complex list structures
- Have search and filter operations return results instantly

**As a mobile user, I want to:**
- Have the application load quickly on slower network connections
- Experience smooth scrolling and interactions on lower-end devices
- Have efficient data usage with intelligent caching
- Maintain good performance even when switching between apps

**As a system administrator, I want to:**
- Monitor application performance metrics in real-time
- Receive alerts when performance degrades below acceptable thresholds
- Have detailed insights into database query performance and bottlenecks
- Ability to optimize resource usage during peak loads

## Spec Scope

### Database Query Optimization

### Frontend Performance Optimization
- Code splitting with dynamic imports and lazy loading
- Bundle size optimization and tree shaking
- Virtual scrolling for large lists and tables
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Web Worker integration for heavy computations

### Real-time Performance Monitoring
- Application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Real-time metrics dashboard for system health
- User experience monitoring and Core Web Vitals tracking
- Database query performance monitoring
- Alert system for performance degradation

### Load Testing and Scalability
- Comprehensive load testing framework
