# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-performance-optimization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Database Performance Architecture
- **Connection Pooling:** PgBouncer with 100 max connections, 20 default pool size
- **Query Cache:** Redis-based query result caching with 24-hour TTL
- **Index Strategy:** Composite indexes on common query patterns, partial indexes for filtered queries
- **Materialized Views:** Pre-computed aggregations refreshed every 15 minutes
- **Query Analysis:** pg_stat_statements for query performance monitoring

### Caching Strategy Implementation
- **L1 Cache:** Browser memory cache (React Query) - 5 minutes TTL
- **L2 Cache:** Redis cluster with 6GB memory, LRU eviction policy
- **L3 Cache:** CDN edge caching for static assets - 30 days TTL
- **Cache Keys:** Hierarchical key structure with user/project/list scope
- **Invalidation:** Event-driven cache invalidation with pub/sub

### Frontend Performance Optimization
- **Bundle Splitting:** Route-based code splitting with 95% cache hit rate target
- **Lazy Loading:** Component-level lazy loading with Suspense boundaries
- **Virtual Scrolling:** react-window for lists >100 items
- **Image Optimization:** WebP format with fallbacks, responsive srcset
- **Web Workers:** Background processing for data transformations

### Real-time Monitoring Stack
- **APM:** New Relic or DataDog for application performance monitoring
- **Frontend:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) with Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Backend:** Custom metrics with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- **Database:** pg_stat_monitor for detailed PostgreSQL metrics
- **Alerting:** PagerDuty integration for critical performance alerts

## Approach

### Phase 1: Database Optimization (Week 1)
- Analyze existing queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Implement strategic indexes and materialized views
- Set up connection pooling and query result caching
- Establish database performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Caching Infrastructure (Week 2)
- Deploy Redis cluster with high availability
- Implement multi-tier caching strategy
- Set up CDN for static asset delivery
- Create cache invalidation event system

### Phase 3: Frontend Performance (Week 3)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Set up Web Workers for heavy computations

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Testing (Week 4)
- Deploy comprehensive monitoring stack
- Implement performance testing framework
- Set up alerting and incident response
- Conduct load testing and optimization
