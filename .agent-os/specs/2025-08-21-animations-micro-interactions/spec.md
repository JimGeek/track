## Overview

Implement a comprehensive animation and micro-interaction system that enhances user experience through smooth transitions, meaningful feedback, and delightful interactions. This feature focuses on creating a polished, responsive interface that guides users through their tasks with visual continuity and emotional engagement while respecting accessibility preferences and device capabilities.

## User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**
- Experience smooth, natural transitions when navigating between pages and sections
- Receive immediate visual feedback when I interact with buttons, forms, and other elements
- See loading states that keep me informed about what's happening behind the scenes
- Have hover effects and micro-interactions that make the interface feel responsive and alive
- Experience consistent animation timing and easing throughout the application

**As a user with accessibility needs, I want to:**
- Have the option to reduce or disable animations based on my preferences
- Experience animations that don't trigger vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity
- Have animations that enhance rather than hinder my ability to use assistive technologies
- Maintain full functionality even when animations are disabled

**As a power user, I want to:**
- Have animation preferences that persist across sessions and devices
- Experience snappy, efficient animations that don't slow down my workflow
- See progress indicators that accurately reflect the status of long-running operations
- Have subtle animations that enhance productivity without being distracting

**As a mobile user, I want to:**
- Experience battery-efficient animations that don't drain my device
- Have animations that feel natural with touch interactions
- See appropriate animation performance based on my device capabilities
- Have animations that work smoothly during orientation changes

## Spec Scope

### Page & Component Transitions
- Smooth page navigation with shared element transitions
- Component mount/unmount animations with proper lifecycle management
- Modal and drawer animations with backdrop effects
- Tab and accordion transitions with height adjustments
- List item animations for add, remove, and reorder operations

### Micro-interactions & Feedback
- Button press animations with appropriate timing and easing
- Form field focus states with subtle highlighting
- Hover effects for interactive elements with proper accessibility
- Loading animations that communicate progress and state
- Success/error feedback with appropriate visual emphasis

### Progress & State Indicators
- Loading spinners and skeleton screens for content loading
- Progress bars for file uploads and long operations
- Step indicators for multi-step processes
- Status change animations for task completion and updates
- Network connectivity status with visual feedback

### Performance & Accessibility
- Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion` system preference
- Performance monitoring and frame rate optimization
- Battery-efficient animations with reduced complexity options
- Graceful degradation for older or lower-powered devices
- Animation preference management system

### Animation System Architecture
- Centralized animation configuration and theming
- Reusable animation components and hooks
- Animation orchestration for complex sequences
- Performance profiling and optimization tools
- Animation debugging and development tools

## Out of Scope

- Complex 3D animations or WebGL effects
- Video or GIF-based animations
- Physics-based animations beyond basic spring physics
- Advanced particle systems or generative animations
- Custom animation engines (will use established libraries)

## Expected Deliverable

A polished, performant animation system that enhances user experience through thoughtful micro-interactions, smooth transitions, and meaningful feedback while maintaining excellent accessibility support and optimal performance across all device types.
