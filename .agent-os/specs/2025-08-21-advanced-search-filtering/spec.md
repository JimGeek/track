## User Stories

1. As a project manager, I want to search across all features and projects using natural language so that I can quickly find relevant information
2. As a developer, I want to use advanced filters to find features by status, assignee, and date ranges so that I can focus on relevant work items
3. As a team lead, I want to save complex search queries so that I can reuse them for regular reporting and tracking
4. As a stakeholder, I want smart search suggestions so that I can discover relevant content without knowing exact search terms
5. As a user, I want to see search analytics and popular searches so that I can learn from team search patterns
