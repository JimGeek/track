# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Sub-Feature Request System
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a hierarchical sub-feature system that enables unlimited nesting depth with parent-child relationships. This system allows users to break down complex features into smaller, manageable sub-features while maintaining clear hierarchical relationships and dependencies.

## User Stories

1. As a project manager, I want to create sub-features under existing features so that I can break down complex work into manageable pieces
2. As a developer, I want to see the hierarchical structure of features and sub-features so that I can understand dependencies and work order
3. As a team lead, I want to nest sub-features at unlimited depth so that I can create detailed task breakdowns
4. As a user, I want to drag and drop sub-features to reorder them within their parent context
5. As a stakeholder, I want to see progress rolled up from sub-features to parent features automatically

## Spec Scope

- Sub-feature CRUD operations with full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- Parent-child relationship management with referential integrity
- Hierarchical display with expandable/collapsible tree structure
- Unlimited nesting depth support with performance optimization
- Dependency management between sub-features and parent features
- Drag-and-drop reordering within hierarchy levels
- Progress rollup from child to parent features
- Bulk operations for moving/copying sub-feature trees
- Search and filtering within hierarchical structures

## Out of Scope

- Cross-project sub-feature relationships
- Advanced dependency types (beyond parent-child)
- Sub-feature templates or cloning
- Time tracking at sub-feature level (Phase 3)
- Advanced permissions per sub-feature level

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional hierarchical sub-feature system that integrates seamlessly with the existing feature request system, providing unlimited nesting capabilities with intuitive UI/UX for managing complex feature breakdowns.
