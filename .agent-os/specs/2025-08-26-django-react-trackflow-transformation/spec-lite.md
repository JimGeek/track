# TrackFlow Transformation - Lite Summary

Transform the existing Django REST Framework + React Track project management platform into Track, a minimalistic todo list application while preserving the Django backend but completely rewriting the frontend interface. This transformation simplifies the complex project/feature hierarchy into simple todo lists and tasks, completely replaces all existing TailwindCSS components with modern shadcn/ui components built from scratch, and rebuilds the three-view system (List, Kanban, Gantt) with clean Vercel/Notion-inspired aesthetics. The approach keeps the valuable Django REST backend while creating an entirely new React frontend interface.

## Key Points
- Transform complex project management into simple todo lists and tasks
- Preserve Django REST Framework + React technology stack
- Maintain three-view system (List, Kanban, Gantt) for task visualization
- Gradually implement shadcn/ui components for modern interface
- Focus on individual productivity and small team collaboration
- Streamline functionality while keeping proven architecture
