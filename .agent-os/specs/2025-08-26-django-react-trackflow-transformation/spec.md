> Spec: Django/React TrackFlow Transformation
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the existing Django REST Framework + React Track project management platform into Track, a minimalistic todo list application with a complete interface rewrite using shadcn/ui. This transformation simplifies the complex project/feature hierarchy into simple todo lists and tasks, completely replaces the existing TailwindCSS interface with modern shadcn/ui components, and rebuilds the three-view system (List, Kanban, Gantt) from scratch with a focus on individual productivity and clean Vercel/Notion-inspired aesthetics.

## User Stories

### Simple Todo List Management
As an individual professional, I want to create multiple todo lists with tasks that have titles, descriptions, priorities (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), start/end dates, and status tracking (Todo/Ongoing/Done), so that I can organize my work across different projects without the complexity of traditional project management features.

**Workflow:** User creates a new todo list, adds tasks with essential properties, and manages them through a clean interface. Tasks can be organized by priority, filtered by due dates, and tracked through simple status progression.

### Multi-View Task Visualization  
As a productivity-focused user, I want to seamlessly switch between List view (traditional todo), Kanban board (status columns), and Gantt chart (timeline) to see my tasks in different contexts, so that I can choose the best visualization for my current workflow needs.

**Workflow:** User opens a todo list and can switch between three completely redesigned views using clean shadcn/ui navigation components, with each view built from scratch to provide optimal task data visualization in modern, minimalistic interface patterns.

### Productivity Dashboard
As someone managing multiple todo lists, I want a simplified dashboard showing tasks due today, tomorrow, this week, and this month, along with recent activity and completion statistics, so that I can quickly understand my workload and productivity trends.

**Workflow:** User opens the application to see a completely redesigned dashboard built with shadcn/ui components, featuring clean card layouts, organized timeframe sections, and modern data visualization replacing all existing interface elements with focused todo insights.

## Spec Scope

1. **Data Model Transformation** - Simplify Projects → TodoLists and Features → Tasks while maintaining Django models and relationships
2. **Complete UI Rewrite** - Replace entire TailwindCSS interface with modern shadcn/ui components built from scratch
3. **Three-View Rebuild** - Completely rebuild List, Kanban, and Gantt views using shadcn/ui components with clean, minimalistic design
4. **Dashboard Redesign** - Create new dashboard from scratch using shadcn/ui cards and layouts with focused todo productivity metrics
5. **Authentication UI Overhaul** - Rebuild authentication pages with shadcn/ui forms while keeping Django JWT backend system

## Out of Scope

- Complete technology stack replacement (keeping Django REST + React)
- Real-time updates or WebSocket implementation  
- Advanced project management features (complex workflows, file attachments, advanced permissions)
- Migration to different hosting platforms (keeping current Vercel + VPS setup)
- Mobile app development or PWA features beyond responsive design

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Django REST API** - Updated models and endpoints supporting todo lists and tasks with the simplified data structure
2. **React Frontend with Complete shadcn/ui Rewrite** - Entirely new UI built from scratch using shadcn/ui components with no existing TailwindCSS components retained
3. **Three Working Views** - List, Kanban, and Gantt views adapted to work seamlessly with the new todo-focused data model
