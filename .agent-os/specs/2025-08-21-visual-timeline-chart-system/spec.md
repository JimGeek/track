# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Visual Timeline & Chart System
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an interactive timeline visualization system for project and feature overlaps with Gantt-style charts. This system will provide visual representation of project timelines, feature dependencies, milestone tracking, and resource allocation with interactive navigation and conflict detection capabilities.

## User Stories

1. As a project manager, I want to see a visual timeline of all features across projects so that I can identify overlaps and resource conflicts
2. As a team lead, I want to view Gantt charts with feature dependencies so that I can plan development sequences effectively
3. As a stakeholder, I want to see milestone progress on a timeline so that I can track project deliverables visually
4. As a developer, I want to see my assigned features on a timeline so that I can understand my workload distribution over time
5. As a product owner, I want to detect and resolve timeline conflicts so that I can optimize project scheduling

## Spec Scope

- Interactive timeline rendering with zoom and pan capabilities
- Gantt-style charts for project and feature visualization
- Overlap detection and conflict identification algorithms
- Milestone tracking and progress visualization
- Resource allocation timeline views
- Drag-and-drop timeline editing for schedule adjustments
- Multi-project timeline views with filtering capabilities
- Export functionality for timeline charts (PDF, PNG, SVG)
- Real-time collaboration features for timeline editing

## Out of Scope

- Advanced project scheduling algorithms (Phase 3)
- Resource capacity planning beyond basic allocation
- Budget timeline integration
- External calendar system synchronization
- Advanced reporting and analytics integration

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive visual timeline and chart system that provides interactive Gantt charts, timeline visualization, conflict detection, and collaborative editing capabilities for effective project timeline management.
