# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-advanced-ui-ux-enhancements/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- **Library:** React DnD with HTML5 backend for desktop, Touch backend for mobile
- **State Management:** Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- **Performance:** Virtual scrolling for large lists during drag operations
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard-accessible alternatives using arrow keys + space/enter

### Keyboard Shortcut System
- **Implementation:** Global event listener with context-aware command routing
- **Conflicts:** Prevent conflicts with browser shortcuts, provide escape mechanisms
- **Customization:** JSON-based shortcut configuration stored in user preferences
- **Documentation:** In-app shortcut help overlay (triggered by ? key)

### Accessibility Framework
- **ARIA Implementation:** Comprehensive roles, properties, and states
- **Focus Management:** Programmatic focus control with visible focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support:** Live regions for dynamic content updates
- **Testing:** Automated accessibility testing with axe-core integration

### User Preferences Architecture
- **Storage:** Local storage with server-side backup for authenticated users
- **Synchronization:** Real-time sync across devices for logged-in users
- **Performance:** Lazy loading of non-critical preferences
- **Migration:** Version-controlled preference schema with migration support

## Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Implement user preferences system with basic theme support
- Set up keyboard shortcut infrastructure with core navigation shortcuts
- Establish accessibility testing framework and baseline ARIA implementation

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2-3)
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality with React DnD
- Build bulk operations interface with multi-select capabilities
- Expand keyboard shortcuts to cover all major actions

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Week 4)
- Complete accessibility compliance testing and fixes
- Implement advanced user preferences (animation, density, shortcuts)
- Performance optimization for drag operations and bulk actions
- Comprehensive testing across devices and assistive technologies

## External Dependencies

### NPM Packages
```json
{
  "react-dnd": "^16.0.1",

}
```

### Browser APIs
- **Drag and Drop API:** For native drag-and-drop support
- **Intersection Observer:** For performance optimization during drag
- **ResizeObserver:** For responsive drag-and-drop areas
- **Local Storage / IndexedDB:** For preference persistence
- **Media Queries:** For reduced motion and high contrast detection

### Performance Considerations
- **Bundle Size:** Code splitting for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Memory Usage:** Efficient event listener cleanup and memoization
- **Rendering:** Virtual scrolling for large lists with drag support
- **Network:** Debounced preference updates to minimize server requests
