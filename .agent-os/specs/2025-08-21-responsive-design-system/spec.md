## Overview

Implement a comprehensive mobile-first responsive design system with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, ensuring consistent and optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes. This feature focuses on creating adaptive layouts, touch-friendly interactions, offline functionality, and device-specific optimizations.

## User Stories

**As a mobile user, I want to:**
- Have a fully functional task management experience optimized for my phone screen
- Use touch gestures naturally for all interactions (swipe, tap, long-press, pinch)
- Access my tasks offline and have changes sync when I'm back online
- Experience fast loading times and smooth animations on my device
- Have the app feel native with proper mobile UI patterns

**As a tablet user, I want to:**
- Utilize the larger screen space efficiently with adaptive layouts
- Switch between portrait and landscape orientations seamlessly
- Use both touch and keyboard inputs effectively
- Have access to more features visible simultaneously than on mobile
- Experience consistent design language across all screen sizes

**As a desktop user switching to mobile, I want to:**
- Have all the same functionality available in a mobile-optimized interface
- Maintain my workflow efficiency despite the smaller screen
- Have my preferences and customizations carry over across devices
- Experience smooth transitions when switching between devices

**As a user with varying network conditions, I want to:**
- Have the app work reliably even on slow or intermittent connections
- See clear indicators when I'm offline or when data is syncing
- Have critical functionality available even without an internet connection
- Experience minimal data usage for basic operations

## Spec Scope

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
- Breakpoint system optimized for all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Touch-first interaction patterns with proper touch target sizes
- Adaptive navigation systems (bottom tabs, drawer, breadcrumbs)
- Responsive typography scale with optimal reading experiences
- Flexible grid system with intelligent content reflow

### Progressive Web App Features
- Service worker implementation for offline functionality
- App manifest for native app-like experience
- Push notification support for task reminders and updates
- Background sync for offline changes
- App installation prompts and home screen integration

### Touch Interaction System
- Gesture recognition for swipe actions (delete, complete, archive)
- Long-press context menus optimized for mobile
- Pull-to-refresh functionality for data updates
- Touch-friendly drag-and-drop with haptic feedback
- Pinch-to-zoom support for detailed views

### Device-Specific Optimizations
- Performance optimizations for lower-end devices
- Battery usage optimization for mobile devices
- Memory usage optimization for resource-constrained devices
- Network usage optimization with intelligent data loading
- Platform-specific UI patterns (iOS/Android conventions)

### Offline-First Architecture
- Local data storage with IndexedDB
- Conflict resolution for offline/online data synchronization
- Queue system for offline actions
- Optimistic updates with rollback capabilities
- Smart data synchronization strategies

## Out of Scope

- Native mobile app development (React Native/Flutter)
- Platform-specific app store deployment
- Advanced gesture recognition beyond standard touch events
- Device-specific hardware integration (camera, GPS beyond basic)
- Complex offline data encryption

## Expected Deliverable

A fully responsive task management application that provides an optimal user experience across all devices, with PWA capabilities for offline functionality and native app-like behavior on mobile devices.
