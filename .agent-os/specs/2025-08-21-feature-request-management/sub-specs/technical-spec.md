# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-feature-request-management/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Django Backend Architecture

**Models Layer**:
- `FeatureRequest` model with comprehensive field definitions and project relationships
- Custom model methods for business logic and computed properties
- Model validation with cross-field validation rules
- Proper meta options for ordering, indexes, and constraints

**API Layer**:
- Django REST Framework ViewSets with nested resource support
- Custom serializers with project relationship handling
- Advanced filtering with django-filter integration
- Pagination and ordering support for large datasets

**Business Logic**:
- Feature request validation service with business rules
- Project-feature relationship validation
- Priority and status transition logic
- Assignment and ownership management

### React Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure**:
```
src/components/features/
├── FeatureList.jsx              # Main listing with project context
├── FeatureCard.jsx              # Individual feature display
├── FeatureForm.jsx              # Create/edit form with rich editor
├── FeatureDetail.jsx            # Detailed view with full metadata
├── FeatureFilters.jsx           # Advanced search and filter controls
├── FeatureBulkActions.jsx       # Bulk operation controls
└── ProjectFeatureView.jsx       # Project-specific feature listing
```

**State Management**:
- React Query for server state with nested resource caching
- Context API for feature-related UI state and filters
- Form state management with React Hook Form and validation
- Optimistic updates for status changes and assignments

**Routing**:
- Nested routes for project-specific feature views
- Dynamic routing with project and feature parameters
- Query parameter handling for filters and pagination
- Breadcrumb navigation for project-feature hierarchy

### Form Handling & Validation

**Client-Side Validation**:
- Required field validation with comprehensive Yup schema
- Rich text editor validation for descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Project association validation and selection
- Real-time validation feedback with error messaging

**Server-Side Validation**:
- DRF serializer validation with custom field validators
- Cross-model validation for project-feature relationships
- Business rule validation for status transitions
- Error message standardization with detailed feedback

### Rich Text Support

**Editor Integration**:
- Rich text editor for feature descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Markdown support for technical documentation
- Media embedding capabilities for mockups and specifications
- Version history for content changes

## Approach

### Database Design Pattern
Using Django's relational model approach with:
- Foreign key relationship to Project model with CASCADE behavior
- Proper indexing strategy for project-based queries
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Audit fields for tracking changes and history

### API Design Pattern
Following REST conventions with nested resources:
- Resource-based URLs (/api/projects/{id}/features/)
- Standard HTTP methods with proper nested resource handling
- Consistent response format with project context
- Bulk operation endpoints for efficiency

### Frontend Architecture Pattern
Component-based architecture with project context:
- Container/Presenter pattern with project-aware components
- Custom hooks for feature management with project context
- Reusable form components with project selection
- Consistent loading and error states across project views

### Data Flow
1. **Read Operations**: React Query → API → Database with Project Join → Component
2. **Write Operations**: Form → Validation → API with Project Context → Database → Cache Update
3. **Project Context**: Project Selection → Feature Filtering → Context-aware Operations

## External Dependencies

### Django Dependencies
```python
# requirements.txt additions
django-filter>=23.2           # For advanced API filtering
django-taggit>=4.0.0         # For tag management system
django-mptt>=0.14.0          # For hierarchical feature organization
django-extensions>=3.2.3     # For development utilities
```

### React Dependencies
```json
{
  "react-query": "^3.39.3",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.45.4",
  "yup": "^1.3.2",
  "@tinymce/tinymce-react": "^4.3.0",
  "react-select": "^5.7.4",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.15.0"
}
```

### Rich Text Editor
- TinyMCE for rich text editing with markdown export
- Custom plugins for feature-specific formatting
- Image upload and media management integration
- Mobile-responsive editor interface

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization with select_related for projects
- Frontend lazy loading for large feature lists
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed project-feature data
- Pagination with infinite scroll for better UX
- Debounced search to reduce API calls

### Security Considerations
- Project-based permission checking for feature access
- CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Input sanitization for rich text content
- Rate limiting for bulk operations
