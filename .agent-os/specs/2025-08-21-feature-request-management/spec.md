> Spec: Feature Request Management
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive feature request lifecycle management within projects, providing detailed tracking and organization capabilities for feature ideas, requirements, and development progress. This system enables users to create, manage, and track feature requests with rich metadata, project associations, and hierarchical organization.

The feature request management system will serve as the core content management layer, allowing teams to capture feature ideas, organize them within projects, track their progress through development stages, and maintain detailed documentation throughout the feature lifecycle.

- Export feature request data for reporting and analysis

**As a developer, I want to:**
- View assigned feature requests with complete technical details
- Update feature request status as I work on implementation
- Add implementation notes and technical documentation
- Link related feature requests and dependencies
- Estimate effort and track time spent on features

**As a stakeholder, I want to:**
- Submit new feature requests with business justification
