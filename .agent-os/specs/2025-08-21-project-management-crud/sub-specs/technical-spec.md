# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-project-management-crud/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Django Backend Architecture

**Models Layer**:
- `Project` model with comprehensive field definitions
- Custom model methods for business logic
- Model validation and clean methods
- Proper meta options for ordering and indexes

**API Layer**:
- Django REST Framework ViewSets for CRUD operations
- Custom serializers with nested relationships
- Filtering and pagination support
- Permission classes for access control

**Business Logic**:
- Project validation service
- Date range validation logic
- Unique name constraint handling
- Status transition validation

### React Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure**:
```
src/components/projects/
├── ProjectList.jsx          # Main listing component
├── ProjectCard.jsx          # Individual project display
├── ProjectForm.jsx          # Create/edit form
├── ProjectDetail.jsx        # Detailed view
├── ProjectFilters.jsx       # Search and filter controls
└── ProjectSettings.jsx      # Project management
```

**State Management**:
- React Query for server state management
- Context API for project-related UI state
- Form state management with React Hook Form
- Optimistic updates for better UX

**Routing**:
- Protected routes for project management
- Dynamic routing for project detail views
- Query parameter handling for filters
- Navigation state preservation

### Form Handling & Validation

**Client-Side Validation**:
- Required field validation with Yup schema
- Date range validation (end date after start date)
- Real-time field validation feedback
- Form submission state management

**Server-Side Validation**:
- DRF serializer validation
- Custom field validators
- Database constraint validation
- Error message standardization

## Approach

### Database Design Pattern
Using Django's Model-First approach with:
- Clear field definitions and constraints
- Proper indexing strategy for performance
- Foreign key relationships with CASCADE behavior
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at) for tracking

### API Design Pattern
Following REST conventions with:
- Resource-based URL structure (/api/projects/)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response format with metadata
- Proper status codes and error handling

### Frontend Architecture Pattern
Component-based architecture with:
- Container/Presenter pattern separation
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Reusable form components
- Consistent loading and error states

### Data Flow
1. **Read Operations**: React Query → API → Database → Serializer → Component
2. **Write Operations**: Form → Validation → API → Database → Update Cache
3. **Error Handling**: API Error → Error Boundary → User Notification

## External Dependencies

### Django Dependencies
```python
# requirements.txt additions
django-filter>=23.2        # For API filtering
django-extensions>=3.2.3   # For development utilities
```

### React Dependencies
```json
{
  "react-query": "^3.39.3",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.45.4",
  "yup": "^1.3.2",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.15.0"
}
```

### Database Considerations
- PostgreSQL for production with proper indexing
- SQLite for development and testing
- Migration strategy for existing data
- Backup considerations for project data

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization with select_related
- Frontend lazy loading for large project lists
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed projects
- Pagination for scalable project listings
