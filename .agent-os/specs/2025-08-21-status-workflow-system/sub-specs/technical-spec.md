# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-status-workflow-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Django Backend Architecture

**State Machine Implementation**:
- Django FSM (Finite State Machine) integration for robust workflow management
- State transition decorators with validation guards
- Custom transition methods with business logic
- Automatic audit trail creation on state changes

**Workflow Engine**:
- `WorkflowManager` service class for centralized workflow logic
- Validation rules engine for transition requirements
- Stage-specific field validation and requirements
- Configurable workflow rules per project type

**Business Logic Layer**:
- Status transition validation with custom business rules
- Time tracking for stage duration and bottleneck analysis
- Notification system for workflow events and milestones
- Progress calculation and workflow analytics

### React Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure**:
```
src/components/workflow/
├── WorkflowVisualization.jsx    # Stage progression display
├── StatusTransition.jsx         # Status change interface
├── WorkflowTimeline.jsx         # Historical timeline view
├── WorkflowMetrics.jsx          # Analytics and metrics dashboard
├── StageIndicator.jsx           # Individual stage status display
├── TransitionButton.jsx         # Action button for status changes
└── WorkflowHistory.jsx          # Audit trail display
```

**State Management**:
- React Query for workflow state with optimistic updates
- Context API for workflow-related UI state and validation
- Custom hooks for workflow operations and status transitions
- Real-time updates for workflow progress tracking

**Routing and Navigation**:
- Workflow-aware routing with status-based access control
- Deep linking to specific workflow stages and history
- Breadcrumb navigation with workflow context
- Query parameter handling for workflow filters

### State Machine Design

**Workflow States**:
```python
class WorkflowStatus(models.TextChoices):
    IDEA = 'idea', 'Idea'
    SPECIFICATION = 'specification', 'Specification'
    DEVELOPMENT = 'development', 'Development'
    TESTING = 'testing', 'Testing'
    LIVE = 'live', 'Live'
```

**Transition Matrix**:
- `idea` → `specification` (Requirements gathering complete)
- `specification` → `development` (Technical specification approved)
- `development` → `testing` (Implementation complete)
- `testing` → `live` (Quality assurance passed)
- Rollback transitions: Any status → Previous status (with validation)

### Validation Framework

**Transition Guards**:
- Business rule validation before status changes
- Required field validation per workflow stage
- Permission-based transition authorization
- Project-specific workflow rule enforcement

**Stage Requirements**:
- **Idea**: Basic title and description required
- **Specification**: Detailed acceptance criteria and business value
- **Development**: Technical notes and effort estimation
- **Testing**: Implementation completion and test criteria
- **Live**: Final validation and deployment confirmation

## Approach

### State Machine Pattern
Using Django FSM for robust state management:
- Decorative transition methods with built-in validation
- Automatic state persistence and consistency
- Event-driven architecture for workflow notifications
- Rollback capabilities with state history preservation

### Event-Driven Architecture
Workflow events trigger downstream processes:
- Status change notifications to stakeholders
- Automatic field validation and requirement enforcement
- Progress metric calculation and analytics updates
- Integration hooks for external systems

### Analytics and Reporting Pattern
Real-time workflow analytics:
- Stage duration tracking with statistical analysis
- Bottleneck identification using queue theory principles
- Throughput measurement and trend analysis
- Predictive completion time estimation

### Data Flow
1. **Status Transition**: User Action → Validation → State Machine → Database → Event Emission
2. **Analytics Update**: State Change → Metrics Calculation → Dashboard Update
3. **History Tracking**: Transition → Audit Log → Timeline Update

## External Dependencies

### Django Dependencies

- Progressive enhancement for workflow visualizations

### Security and Permissions

**Workflow Security**:
- Role-based access control for status transitions
- Object-level permissions for workflow operations
- Audit trail for all workflow changes and access
- Validation of user permissions before transitions

**Data Protection**:
- Encrypted status change reasons in audit trail
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Rate limiting for workflow operations
- Input sanitization for workflow-related data
