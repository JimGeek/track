# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Status Workflow System
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive 5-stage workflow system (Idea → Specification → Development → Testing → Live) that governs the lifecycle of feature requests. This system will provide structured progression through development phases with validation rules, progress tracking, automated transitions, and complete audit trail functionality.

The status workflow system serves as the backbone for feature request management, ensuring consistent process adherence, preventing invalid transitions, tracking progress metrics, and providing visibility into the development pipeline from initial concept to production deployment.

## User Stories

**As a product manager, I want to:**
- Define and enforce workflow rules for feature request progression
- Track feature requests through each stage of development
- View progress metrics and bottlenecks in the workflow
- Set up automatic status transitions based on conditions
- Generate reports on workflow efficiency and team performance

**As a developer, I want to:**
- Understand the current status and next steps for feature requests
- Move feature requests through workflow stages as work progresses
- See validation rules and requirements for status transitions
- Track time spent in each workflow stage
- Receive notifications for status changes and assignments

**As a team lead, I want to:**
- Monitor team progress across the workflow stages
- Identify bottlenecks and process improvements
- Set up approval gates for critical workflow transitions
- Track metrics like cycle time and throughput
- Ensure quality gates are met before progression

**As a stakeholder, I want to:**
- Understand where feature requests are in the development process
- Receive notifications when features reach specific milestones
- View estimated completion times based on workflow progress
- Access historical data on feature development timelines

## Spec Scope

### Core Workflow Management
- **5-Stage Pipeline**: Structured progression through Idea → Specification → Development → Testing → Live
- **Transition Rules**: Business logic for valid status transitions with validation
- **State Machine**: Robust state management with transition guards and actions
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed metrics on time spent in each stage

### Validation and Business Rules
- **Transition Validation**: Enforce business rules for status changes
- **Required Fields**: Stage-specific field requirements and validation
- **Approval Gates**: Optional approval requirements for critical transitions
- **Rollback Handling**: Safe rollback to previous stages when needed

### Audit Trail and History
- **Status History**: Complete audit trail of all status changes
- **Change Attribution**: Track who made changes and when
- **Reason Tracking**: Capture reasons for status transitions
- **Timeline Visualization**: Visual representation of workflow progress

### Progress Analytics
- **Stage Metrics**: Time spent in each workflow stage
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Detect stages with longest duration
- **Throughput Analysis**: Track features moving through the pipeline
- **Cycle Time Calculation**: End-to-end time from idea to live

## Out of Scope

- Complex branching workflows or parallel processing paths
- Advanced approval workflows with multiple approvers
- Integration with external CI/CD pipeline systems
- Automated testing validation before status transitions
- Complex business rule engines with conditional logic
- Advanced workflow analytics and predictive modeling
- Custom workflow definitions per project or team
- Advanced notification systems with custom triggers

## Expected Deliverable

A complete status workflow system with:

1. **Django Backend Components**:
   - State machine implementation with transition rules
   - Status validation and business logic enforcement
   - Audit trail models for status change history
   - API endpoints for status transitions and workflow data

2. **React Frontend Components**:
   - Workflow visualization with stage indicators
   - Status transition interfaces with validation feedback
   - Progress tracking dashboards and metrics views
   - Timeline visualization for workflow history

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Enhanced status field with proper constraints
   - Status history table with audit trail capability
   - Workflow metrics and performance tracking tables

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - Status transition endpoints with validation
   - Workflow analytics and reporting endpoints
   - Audit trail access and filtering capabilities
