> Spec: Complete TrackFlow Rewrite
> Created: 2025-08-26

## Overview

Complete rewrite of the existing Django-based project management platform into TrackFlow, a minimalistic todo list application using Next.js 15+ with shadcn/ui components. This rewrite discards all existing code and implements a lightweight, fast, and clean todo management system with List, Kanban, and Gantt views inspired by Vercel and Notion's minimalistic aesthetic.

## User Stories

### Simple Todo Management

As an individual professional, I want to create multiple todo lists with tasks that have priorities, start dates, end dates, and status tracking, so that I can organize my work across different projects without the complexity of traditional project management tools.

**Workflow:** User creates a new todo list, adds tasks with title, description, priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), dates, and status (Todo/Ongoing/Done). Tasks can be viewed and managed across three different visualization modes.

### Multi-View Task Visualization

As a productivity-focused user, I want to seamlessly switch between List view, Kanban board, and Gantt chart to see my tasks in different contexts, so that I can choose the best visualization for my current workflow and thinking style.

**Workflow:** User opens a todo list and can instantly switch between List (traditional todo), Kanban (status columns), and Gantt (timeline) views without losing context or requiring page refreshes.

### Intelligent Dashboard

As someone managing multiple projects, I want a dashboard showing tasks due today, tomorrow, this week, and this month along with recent activity, so that I can quickly understand my upcoming workload and recent changes without navigating through individual lists.

**Workflow:** User opens the application and sees a clean dashboard with organized sections for different timeframes, latest activity feed, and quick access to urgent tasks.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Technology Stack Replacement** - Replace Django/React architecture with Next.js 15+ full-stack application using App Router
2. **New Data Architecture** - Implement simple task-based schema with Prisma ORM replacing complex hierarchical feature system
3. **Three View System** - Build List, Kanban, and Gantt chart components with seamless switching
4. **Minimalistic UI System** - Implement shadcn/ui components with Vercel/Notion-inspired design system
5. **Dashboard Implementation** - Create intelligent dashboard with date-based task organization and activity tracking

## Out of Scope

- Migration of existing Django data (complete fresh start)
- Complex project hierarchies or sub-features
- File attachment system
- Advanced team management and permissions
- Workflow automation and complex rule systems
- Audit trails beyond basic activity tracking
- Backward compatibility with existing API

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Next.js Application** - Complete working todo application deployed on Vercel with sub-second loading times
2. **Three Working Views** - List, Kanban, and Gantt chart views all functional with real-time data synchronization
3. **Clean Minimalistic Interface** - shadcn/ui implementation matching Vercel/Notion aesthetic standards with responsive design
