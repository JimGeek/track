## Overview

Implement a comprehensive data export system that allows users to export their tracking data in multiple formats with advanced filtering, custom report generation, and scheduled export capabilities. The system will provide enterprise-grade export functionality with async processing, secure downloads, and audit logging.

## User Stories

### As a user, I want to:
- Export my tracking data in CSV, JSON, or PDF formats for external analysis
- Generate custom reports with specific time ranges and data filtering
- Schedule regular exports to be automatically generated and delivered
- Download previous exports from a secure history interface
- Receive email notifications when exports are ready for download
- Preview export data before finalizing the download
- Share exported data securely with team members or external stakeholders

### As a power user, I want to:
- Create custom export templates with specific data fields and formatting
- Set up automated reports that are generated and emailed on schedules
- Export data with advanced filtering by tags, categories, date ranges, and custom criteria
- Generate executive summaries and analytical reports in PDF format
- Track export usage and performance metrics

### As an administrator, I want to:
- Monitor export activity and resource usage across all users
- Set export limits and quotas to manage system performance
- Audit export history for compliance and security purposes
- Configure global export settings and available formats
- Manage export retention policies and cleanup schedules

## Spec Scope

### Export Formats
- **CSV Export**: Structured data with customizable columns and formatting
- **JSON Export**: Complete data structure with nested relationships
- **PDF Export**: Formatted reports with charts, summaries, and branding
- **Excel Export**: Advanced spreadsheet format with multiple sheets and formulas

### Custom Filtering

- Tag-based filtering with multi-select capabilities
- Category and project-based filtering
- Custom field filtering with operators (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
- Search query integration for text-based filtering

### Scheduled Exports
- Recurring export schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Custom cron-style scheduling for advanced users
- Email delivery of scheduled exports with secure download links
- Schedule management interface with pause/resume functionality
- Notification preferences for scheduled export results

### Report Templates
- Pre-built templates for common report types (time tracking summary, project analysis, productivity reports)
- Custom template builder with drag-and-drop field selection
- Template sharing and collaboration features
- Version control for template modifications
- Template performance analytics and usage tracking

### Security & Compliance
- Secure download URLs with expiration and access controls
- Export encryption for sensitive data
- Audit logging of all export activities
- GDPR compliance with data anonymization options
- Role-based access controls for export functionality

## Out of Scope

- Real-time data streaming exports (future consideration)
- Integration with external BI tools (Phase 2)
- Advanced data visualization within exports (charts limited to PDF)
- Bulk export API for third-party integrations (future enhancement)
- Export format conversion after generation (user must select format upfront)
