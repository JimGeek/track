# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-21-data-export-functionality/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- **Background Processing**: Celery with Redis broker for async export generation
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or local storage with secure URL generation
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV/Excel, jsPDF for PDF generation, native JSON serialization
- **Caching**: Redis for export status tracking and temporary data storage
- **Security**: JWT-based download authentication, file encryption at rest

### Performance Requirements
- Support exports up to 100,000 records without timeout
- Maximum export generation time: 5 minutes for large datasets
- Concurrent export limit: 10 simultaneous jobs per user
- File retention: 30 days for completed exports
- Download speed: Minimum 1MB/s for large files

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling support for Celery workers
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Chunked data processing for large exports
- CDN integration for global download performance
- Auto-scaling based on export queue depth

## Approach

### Export Processing Pipeline

1. **Request Validation**
   - Validate user permissions and export limits
   - Sanitize and validate filter parameters
   - Check data access permissions for requested records
   - Generate unique export job ID and tracking token

2. **Data Collection & Processing**
   - Execute optimized database queries with pagination
   - Apply user-defined filters and transformations
   - Handle data serialization and format conversion
   - Implement progress tracking for long-running jobs

3. **File Generation**
   - Generate files in requested format using appropriate libraries
   - Apply templates and custom formatting rules
   - Compress large files for faster downloads
   - Generate secure download URLs with expiration

4. **Notification & Delivery**
   - Send email notifications with download links
   - Update export status in real-time via WebSocket
   - Log all export activities for audit purposes
   - Schedule cleanup of expired files

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial exports when some data is inaccessible
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **User Communication**: Clear error messages with resolution steps
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting for system failures

### Data Transformation Pipeline

```python
# Example export processing flow
class ExportProcessor:
    def process_export(self, export_request):
        # 1. Validate and prepare
        self.validate_request(export_request)
        
        # 2. Collect data in chunks
        data_chunks = self.collect_data_chunks(export_request)
        
        # 3. Transform and format
        formatted_data = self.transform_data(data_chunks, export_request.format)
        
        # 4. Generate file
        file_path = self.generate_file(formatted_data, export_request)
        
        # 5. Upload to secure storage
        download_url = self.upload_and_generate_url(file_path)
        
        # 6. Notify user
        self.send_completion_notification(export_request, download_url)
```
